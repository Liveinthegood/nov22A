    <h3 class="title2">HYAPATIA IS THE FOUNDER OF NATIVE STRENGTH</h3>



  <h1 class="bodytext"> After experiencing a successful traditional ceremony to have a baby, Hyapatia began studying with two medicine men, a medicine woman (Gladys Tantaquideon, brother to the last chief of the Mohicans), and a Hawaiian Kahuna. These teachers shared traditional wisdom from the Mayan, Lakota, Cherokee, Hawaiian, and many other cultures.</h1> 

  <hr>

  <h1 class="bodytext">In 2001 Hyapatia was elected to the prestigious position of Blessed Woman for the Lost River band of the Cherokee. Every weekend she taught the people to speak Cherokee, conducted pipe ceremonies and presided over sweat lodges, healing ceremonies. As Hypatia began to teach the many things she had learned from the elders, it became apparent that this information was just as useful to the members of the Lost River band as it had been to her.</h1>

  <h3 class="title2">TEACHING TRIANGLES AND MEDICINE WHEELS HELP NATIVE STRENGTH</h3>


  <img class="picture" src="images/circleT.png" alt="teaching triangle to come picture">


  <h1 class="bodytext">Teaching Triangles (one example directly above) represents the unity of all creation connected by a central axis. Think of a Triangle as it has three sides, where these three realms are represented as the sky, the Earth and the underworld. </h1> 


  <img class="picture" src="images/MedicineWheel_mainone.jpg" alt="medicine wheel main one picture">



    
 <h1 class="bodytext">Medicine Wheels (one example directly above) help us to remember and comprehend this complicated system. This collection became known as Native Strength as it awakens the strength that is inside each of us.</h1>
